##description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about html and css, experiment with different codes and improve my skills. I built this project to compare the different code that can be used to make the code more organized and clean.
I learned new types of codes that replaces the existing one on the project
My project is a web page that has information about social media.I used and changed some features because it gives the web page more organization and I added some description for all the images.
